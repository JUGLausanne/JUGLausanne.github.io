A talk about achieving Zero-Downtime with a Spring-Boot application deployed on DigitalOcean with Ansible. The author shares how, in his company, zero-downtime imposed as a requirement. He also shares the challenges most are likely to face while taking that path.

#### Speaker

Louis has been building softwares in Java since 2002, mostly for finance, health and media organizations. He states that 4 softwares families disrupted the way people develop on the JVM, raising it  from a painful platform to a great platform:

- modern build tools (Maven/Gradle).

- lightweight containers (Spring/JEE)

- testing tools: JUnit/Mockito/...

- configuration management tools: Ansible/Chef...

He's lately focused on Agile Ops in the scope of Quality Insurance: easily cloning production environments, greatly improves the testing process and increases the confidence in the delivery.
