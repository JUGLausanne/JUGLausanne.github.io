Batch processing served us well for last 10s of years. Most of developers have a good idea what does it mean to design & implement a batch processing system. However business often requires real-time insight into big data.
The talk will walk through basic concepts of stream processing. Then we will discuss the notion of time in a streaming system, aggregations and windowing. We will also touch some of the operational concerns unique to stream processing and complement our understanding with some cool application demonstrations.
