Guillaume is going to give an overview of how full text search works for Wikipedias. You will learn what it takes to make Elasticsearch work for a top 5 website in 200 > langages. From the basic principles of full text search, to the scalability issues of a large site, with stop in how to design a resilient search cluster.

#### Speaker

After a few years working for various industries in Switzerland, Guillaume decided it was time to redeem his karma. He is now working for Wikimedia Foundation (Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. [Thatâ€™s our commitment](https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/vision/)). His current work is focused on Site Reliability Engineering for [Search](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Search), [Maps](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Maps) and [Wikidata Query Service](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidata_query_service).
